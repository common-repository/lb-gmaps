Just another Google Maps plugin but simpler and with a live preview.

== Description ==
LB Gmaps simply implements the Google Maps API, allowing users to create and style maps by their preferences. The thing that distinguishes this plugin from the others is that each change you make to your map is directly applied to a sample map right next to the map options.

= LB Gmaps Needs Your Help to Improve The Overall Experience =
The plugin is completely free and does not have any extensions you will be asked to pay for. That's why I will need your help to add new and extend the current functionality of the plugin. I will be very glad to hear your feedback and ideas.

= Installation and Setup =
The installation is really simple.
1. Upload the entire `lb-gmaps` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin via the "Plugins" menu in the WordPress dashboard.
3. Go to the "Settings" page of the plugin and add your Google Maps API Key.
4. Enjoy!
